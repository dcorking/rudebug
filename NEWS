This file sums up important changes that happened between releases.

== rudebug 0.3.2
* And now that fix works again in ruby-gtk2-0.16.0-1 (method_defined?() only
  checks public and protected methods, not private ones... d'uh!)

== rudebug 0.3.1
* Fixed a bug where rudebug wouldn't work with ruby-gtk2-0.14.1-1 because of a
  fix from gtk-patch.rb

== rudebug 0.3.0
* Initial release
