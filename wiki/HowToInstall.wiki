#summary Detailed instructions for how to install rudebug.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= On Windows =

1. Get ruby-gtk2 to work. See http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows (This shouldn't be too much work and you only need to do it once.)

2. Install rudebug by typing `gem install rudebug` into a console. This will automatically install all dependencies as well. (Once I actually release the gem file, that is.)

= On Mac OS X =

I'm not even able to get an X11 build of GTK2 to work on my !MacBook using either !DarwinPorts or Fink. Sorry.
I might port this to ruby-cocoa in the future.
